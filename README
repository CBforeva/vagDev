# VagDev

A simple project to ease the setting up of development VMs for the
CMS conditions (and possible other environments) using vagrant. 

Coordinated via one branch per architecture (and possibly later topic).

   git clone -b slc6 https://github.com/apfeiffer1/vagDev.git slc6
   cd slc6
   vagrant up
   vagrant ssh

should be all you need to set up a devbox and use it. 

Enjoy ! :)
