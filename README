# VagDev

A simple project to ease the setting up of development VMs for the
CMS conditions (and possible other environments) using vagrant. 

   git clone https://github.com/apfeiffer1/vagDev.git 
   cd slc6
   vagrant up
   vagrant ssh

should be all you need to set up a devbox and use it. 

Enjoy ! :)
